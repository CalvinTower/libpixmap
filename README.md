# PixMap library in C
Libpixmap is a library to read and write pixmap image formats with a simple to use API.

Currently, libpixmap is going under a total rewrite. This is because I have grown my skills and confidence in C. Now I have a better idea of how to structure my code and the API. The API previously for libpixmap was not satisfactory and not to my liking. Hopefully, under this refactoring, libpixmap will have better code.
